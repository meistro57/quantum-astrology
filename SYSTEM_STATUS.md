# Quantum Astrology - System Status

**Version:** 0.2.0-dev
**Status:** 🚧 Core platform under active development
**Last Updated:** September 18, 2025

## 📌 Overview
- The project is in early alpha with core chart generation, authentication, and API scaffolding in place.
- Swiss Ephemeris CLI integration powers natal charts; transits and reporting services exist but still need polish and UI coverage.
- Significant enterprise and AI-assisted features listed in the roadmap are not yet implemented.

## 🚦 Implementation Snapshot

### ✅ Stable & Usable Today
- **Swiss Ephemeris service** via `QuantumAstrology\\Core\\SwissEphemeris` for planetary and house calculations.
- **Natal chart pipeline** (`Chart::generateNatalChart`) storing planets, houses, aspects, and metadata in the `charts` table.
- **Authentication & chart CRUD** flows covering registration, login, chart creation/listing (`api/chart_create.php`, `api/charts_list.php`, `classes/Charts/Chart.php`).
- **REST endpoints** for health checks, chart retrieval, SVG export, and chart listing within the authenticated API surface.

### 🧪 In Active Development / Needs Validation
- **Transit calculations** exposed at `api/transits.php` using `TransitService`; requires broader QA and UI integration.
- **Report generation** scaffolding (`classes/Reports`) with mPDF dependency but lacking finished templates and workflows.
- **Front-end polish**: chart wheel visuals exist, but aspects like zodiac wedges, glyph styling, and responsive layouts still need refinement.

### ⏳ Not Yet Implemented
- Enterprise tooling (comparison dashboards, advanced filtering, collaboration).
- AI-driven interpretations, multilingual support, and mobile apps.
- Rich PDF exports and interactive transit timelines promised in ROADMAP but not delivered.

## ⚙️ Operational Notes
- Configure `SWEPH_PATH` and ephemeris data directories before production use; falls back to analytical approximations if swetest is unavailable.
- Database migrations live under `tools/migrate.php`; ensure `.env` is set with database credentials.
- Sessions underpin authentication—HTTPS and secure cookie settings are required before deployment.

## 🧪 Test Coverage
- Automated PHPUnit suite available (`composer test`) covering configuration and session helpers; domain logic lacks dedicated tests.
- Manual verification still required for chart math, transit accuracy, and PDF exports.

## 🚀 Next Immediate Focus
- Harden transit calculations with regression fixtures and UI/UX surfaces.
- Finish SVG wheel enhancements (zodiac wedges, glyph assets) and bundle caching.
- Produce end-to-end chart/report tests to secure the core experience.
