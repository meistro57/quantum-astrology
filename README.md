## Overview

Quantum Astrology provides professional-grade astrological calculations and chart generation with a modern, intuitive interface. Built on the Swiss Ephemeris for astronomical accuracy, the system integrates seamlessly with the Quantum Minds United ecosystem.

---

## 🔜 Next Development Phase

- Progressions and solar returns hardening + test coverage  
- Expand report templates and interpretation depth  
- API consistency cleanup (response shape/versioning across legacy and newer endpoints)  
- End-to-end regression tests for chart create/list/delete/export flows  
- UX polish for large chart libraries (filters/search and richer pagination controls)  
- AI report quality controls (prompt templates, section tuning, and output style presets)

---

## 📌 Future Features

- Synastry & composite charts  
- PDF report generation with QMU branding  
- AI-powered interpretation system  
- Multi-language support  
- Mobile app integration (React Native)  

---

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: PHP 8+ with PSR-4 autoloading  
- **Database**: MySQL 8+ with JSON column support  
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS with Quantum UI components  
- **Charts**: SVG generation with responsive scaling  
- **Auth**: Session-based login with secure password hashing  
- **Calculations**: Swiss Ephemeris (swetest CLI)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- PHP 8.0 or higher  
- MySQL 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+  
- Apache 2.4+ or Nginx 1.18+  
- Composer for dependency management  

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/meistro57/quantum-astrology.git
cd quantum-astrology
composer install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your database + swetest path
php tools/migrate.php
bash start_server.sh

# production (docker compose)
bash startup.sh
# stop production containers
bash shutdown.sh
```

### Production Docker Setup (Explicit)

Use this checklist for a production-safe deployment:

1. Copy and edit environment settings:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Set secure production values in `.env` (minimum):
   ```env
   APP_ENV=production
   APP_DEBUG=false
   APP_URL=https://your-domain.example
   SERVER_NAME=your-domain.example
   DB_DRIVER=mysql
   DB_HOST=db
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=quantum_astrology
   DB_USER=quantum_app
   DB_PASS=replace_with_strong_password
   MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=replace_with_strong_root_password
   HTTP_PORT=80
   HTTPS_PORT=443
   TLS_MODE=real
   TLS_CERT_FILE=server.crt
   TLS_KEY_FILE=server.key
   ```
3. Provide TLS material:
   - `TLS_MODE=self-signed`: `startup.sh` auto-generates cert/key in `docker/certs/`.
   - `TLS_MODE=real`: place cert/key files at `docker/certs/${TLS_CERT_FILE}` and `docker/certs/${TLS_KEY_FILE}`.
4. Start the stack:
   ```bash
   bash startup.sh
   ```
5. Verify containers and app health:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
   curl -k https://your-domain.example/api/health.php
   ```
6. Stop services when needed:
   ```bash
   bash shutdown.sh
   ```

`startup.sh` enforces TLS mode checks and the Nginx proxy redirects HTTP (`80`) to HTTPS (`443`).
For full details and troubleshooting, see [`docs/production-docker.md`](docs/production-docker.md).

### Pre-Push Documentation Guard

Enable the tracked pre-push hook so code changes require corresponding doc updates before push:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook blocks pushes when source files change without updates to docs such as `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, `SYSTEM_STATUS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or files under `docs/`.

If you need a one-off bypass:

```bash
SKIP_DOCS_CHECK=1 git push
```

Production note: `docker-compose.prod.yml` includes default credentials for first boot only.
Always rotate `DB_PASS` and `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` before exposing the stack publicly.

### Admin Panel Access

`/admin` is restricted to admin users. A user is treated as admin when any of the following is true:

- User ID is `1`
- `users.is_admin = 1`
- User email is listed in `ADMIN_EMAILS` (comma-separated) or `ADMIN_EMAIL`

Once an admin is signed in, user administration (create/reset/grant/revoke) is available directly inside `/admin`.

`/admin` also controls system AI settings, including:
- master AI provider/model/API key
- AI summary system prompt/style/length/focus template

When set, these admin AI settings are treated as the system defaults used by report/chart AI flows.

`/admin` also includes:
- system operations buttons for syntax checks, migrations, cache rebuild, storage audit, and chart smoke checks
- database backup create/list/download/delete controls
- a quick link to GitHub Issues (configured via `GITHUB_ISSUES_URL`)

### Environment Variables

Consult [`docs/environment.md`](docs/environment.md) for a complete catalogue of supported environment variables, including
database credentials, Swiss Ephemeris paths, caching controls, and session tuning. The guide outlines defaults, production
considerations, and a sample `.env` layout to accelerate both local prototyping and secure deployments.

### Maintenance Utilities

- `php tools/clear-cache.php` — clears the application cache using the shared storage maintenance routines.
- `php tools/manage-storage.php --list` — inspects cache, ephemeris, chart, and report directories with a friendly audit summary.
- `php tools/manage-storage.php --purge --target=ephemeris --older-than=30` — prunes cached ephemeris files older than 30 days, keeping recent calculations intact.
